Nobody stumbles into a sanctuary by accident. ✨ For a first visit, I always suggest the Sound Bath ($77, 30 min): no touch, nothing to believe, nothing to be good at. You lie down under blankets and let bowls tuned to 432 Hz do the work. Or start with a free 30-minute Discovery Call and let Tamika point you to the right door.",

It traveled west through Hawayo Takata in the 1930s and is now offered in hospitals and hospice programs worldwide.

Tuned low, that nudges you toward theta waves, the slow rhythm of deep meditation and the edge of sleep. And it's studied: a meta-analysis of 22 experiments found a consistent, significant effect on anxiety, with longer listening working better — which is exactly what 30 unbroken minutes under the bowls gives you.",

    answer:
      "There's real research here, love. A University of California San Diego study of 62 adults found singing-bowl meditation significantly reduced tension, anger, fatigue, and depressed mood — and here's my favorite part: first-timers showed the biggest drop in tension of anyone. Researchers called it a low-cost, low-risk intervention for anxiety and low mood. Delta Roe never overclaims — this is deep rest, not medicine — but the deep rest itself is measurably real.",

    answer:
      "Honest answer, as always: the research on 432 Hz is young but interesting. Small controlled studies found music tuned to 432 Hz lowered heart rate (about 5 beats per minute versus standard 440 Hz tuning), nudged blood pressure and breathing down, and improved sleep quality in one clinical pilot. These are pilots, not proof — but they match what clients report in the room: 432 feels warmer, rounder, easier to surrender to. Put headphones on the 60-second sample and let your own nervous system vote.",

      "Fascia is the connective web wrapping every muscle, organ, and nerve — one continuous sheet from scalp to sole. Researchers now consider it one of the body's richest sensory organs, packed with nerve endings that register tension and threat. When stress becomes chronic, fascia is where the bracing lives — that armor massage keeps finding but not releasing. The Fascia Flow Reset works because of the pairing: gentle sustained release while the sound bath keeps your nervous system in rest-and-release instead of guarding.",

      "Here's the thread under everything at Delta Roe: your nervous system has two gears — fight-or-flight (sympathetic) and rest-and-repair (parasympathetic) — and modern life leaves most of us stuck in the first one, marinating in cortisol. Sound, reiki, breath, and stillness are all doorways to the second gear: heart rate settles, breathing slows, digestion and repair switch back on. That's why 30 minutes can change your whole week — you're not escaping your life, you're switching the gear it runs in.",

      "Sweet question — the session keeps working after you leave. Most people float out calm and clear; some feel wonderfully sleepy, extra emotional, or thirsty for a few hours — that's your system completing what it started on the table, not something going wrong. The care plan is simple: drink more water than usual, keep the evening soft if you can, let feelings move through without gripping them, and sleep.
