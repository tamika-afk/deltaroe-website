              frequency, price and cancellation method to be disclosed clearly
              and conspicuously *next to* the signup action — not buried in a
              terms page — with affirmative consent, a retainable confirmation,

              ⚠️ Right now these CTAs are mailto: links, so signup is not yet
              online. THE DAY membership signup becomes an online checkout, the

            <strong>cancel at any time — no fee, no notice period, no phone call
            required</strong>. Cancelling stops the next payment; the month you have
            already paid for stays yours to use in full. The Soulful Journey is a
            12-month program billed monthly. Full terms are in the{" "}

            A single reiki session is $144. Ritual members receive a monthly

            for $129. The membership pays for itself the moment you show up,
            which is exactly the point: <em>it makes showing up automatic.</em>
